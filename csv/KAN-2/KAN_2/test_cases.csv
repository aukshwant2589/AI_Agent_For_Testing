And Assert that the response body's 'errors' field is null or empty.,Assert that the 'data.getScore' object is not null and contains the expected score details.,"The API returns a 200 OK status. The response body contains the correct score data, matching the expected schema (e.g., studentId, score, assessmentDate). The 'errors' field in the response is null or empty."
TC2: Verify API response with an invalid authentication token,The GraphQL endpoint is running.,Prepare a valid GraphQL query for 'getScore'. And Set the 'Authorization' header with an invalid or expired bearer token. And Send the POST request to the GraphQL endpoint.,Validate the HTTP status code.,The API returns a 401 Unauthorized (or similar authentication error) status code.
